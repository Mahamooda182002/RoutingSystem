# Real-Time Traffic Routing System

The Real-Time Traffic Routing System is a software application that allows users to find the optimal route between two locations, taking into account real-time traffic data. The system utilizes graph algorithms, real-time data integration, and a user-friendly interface to provide users with the most efficient routes based on current traffic conditions.

## Features

- Integration with real-time traffic data APIs for up-to-date traffic information.
- Graph-based routing algorithms to calculate the shortest and most efficient routes.
- User interface for easy input of source and destination locations.
- Display of the optimal route with estimated travel time.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NetworkX library (can be installed using `pip install networkx`)
- Requests library (can be installed using `pip install requests`)
- Tkinter library (usually included with standard Python installations)

- Run the application:
Input the source and destination locations in the user interface.

Click the "Calculate Route" button to find the optimal route.

The calculated route and estimated travel time will be displayed

Configuration
Replace the mock_api_url in the fetch_real_time_traffic_data function with the actual API endpoint for fetching real-time traffic dat
