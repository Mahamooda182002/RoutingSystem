# Real-Time Traffic Routing System

The Real-Time Traffic Routing System is a software application that allows users to find the optimal route between two locations, taking into account real-time traffic data. The system utilizes graph algorithms, real-time data integration, and a user-friendly interface to provide users with the most efficient routes based on current traffic conditions.
Steps:

Data Collection: Obtain map data, road networks, and real-time traffic data from Map APIs and real-time traffic data providers.

Data Preprocessing: Convert map data into a graph structure using NetworkX, where nodes represent intersections and edges represent roads.

Real-Time Traffic Data Integration: Integrate real-time traffic data into the graph structure, updating edge weights (travel times) based on current traffic conditions.

Algorithm Design: Implement a shortest path algorithm like Dijkstra's or A* to find the most efficient route between source and destination nodes.

User Interface: Create a user interface (web or mobile app) where users can input their source and destination locations.

Real-Time Traffic Data Retrieval: Fetch real-time traffic data from a traffic data provider's API. This data will be used to update the graph's edge weights.

Update Graph Edge Weights: Periodically update the graph's edge weights based on the real-time traffic data. You can use a scheduler or event-driven approach to update the weights.

Shortest Path Calculation: Implement the chosen shortest path algorithm to calculate the most efficient route based on the current traffic conditions.

Display Route: Display the calculated route on the user interface, along with estimated travel time, distance, and other relevant information

## Features

- Integration with real-time traffic data APIs for up-to-date traffic information.
- Graph-based routing algorithms to calculate the shortest and most efficient routes.
- User interface for easy input of source and destination locations.
- Display of the optimal route with estimated travel time.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NetworkX library (can be installed using `pip install networkx`)
- Requests library (can be installed using `pip install requests`)
- Tkinter library (usually included with standard Python installations)

- Run the application:
Input the source and destination locations in the user interface.

Click the "Calculate Route" button to find the optimal route.

The calculated route and estimated travel time will be displayed

Configuration
Replace the mock_api_url in the fetch_real_time_traffic_data function with the actual API endpoint for fetching real-time traffic dat
